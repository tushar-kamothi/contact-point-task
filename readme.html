## 📌 Objective

This repository demonstrates **end-to-end ownership of a real-world WordPress project**, covering:

- Local WordPress environment setup
- Introducing **intentional, real performance issues**
- Fixing performance problems **without one-click optimization plugins**
- Applying WordPress **security best practices**
- Handling common **edge cases**
- Debugging JavaScript issues caused by performance optimizations
- Maintaining a **clean, time-bound Git workflow**

> ⏱️ All tasks were executed within the **5-hour time constraint**, following professional development practices.

## 🖥️ Local Environment Setup

**Local stack**
- Tool: Local by Flywheel
- PHP Version: 8.x
- WordPress Version: Latest stable

**Theme & Builder**
- Theme: Hello Elementor
- Page Builder: Elementor (Free)

---

## 🔌 Installed Plugins

The following plugins were installed to simulate a realistic production environment:

- Elementor
- WPforms
- SureRank SEO
- Wordfence Security
- Ultimate Addon For Elementor

---

## 🏠 Homepage Structure

The homepage was intentionally designed to reflect a **real client-facing website**, including:

- Hero section with a **large image** (used as LCP element)
- Image / media content section
- Contact form
- Two Call-To-Action (CTA) sections

This layout helped reproduce common performance and UX challenges found in production WordPress sites.

## 🔐 Security & Edge Case Handling

Security best practices followed in custom code:

- Input sanitization using `sanitize_text_field()`
- Output escaping using `esc_html()`
- CSRF protection using `wp_nonce_field()` and `check_ajax_referer()`
- Secure AJAX handling for both logged-in and guest users

**Edge cases handled**
- Empty or invalid user input
- Missing or invalid nonce in AJAX requests
- No data / unexpected request scenarios

---

## 🐞 Debugging & JS Conflict Resolution

During JavaScript deferring and optimization:

- Elementor frontend features initially broke
- Root cause identified as dependency execution order
- Critical scripts were excluded from deferring
- Performance gains were preserved without reverting fixes

This demonstrated **practical debugging and trade-off handling**.
